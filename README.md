# **Project Name: Sound Detection and Alert System for ATAK**

### **Description**
A system designed to detect high-decibel sound events (e.g., gunshots) and visualize them in real time on the Team Awareness Kit (TAK) platform. This project integrates hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi, sound sensors) with AI models to enhance situational awareness for public safety and military operations.

### **About the Project**
- **Goal:** To detect and classify gunshots and other high-decibel sound events.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Real-time sound detection.  
  - Integration with TAK for immediate situational awareness.  
  - Support for multiple firearm calibers and sound profiles.  

---

### **System Architecture**
- **TAK Server Setup:**  
  Details the server configurations, including encryption, certificates, and integrations.  
- **Raspberry Pi Configuration:**  
  Explains how the Raspberry Pi is configured to process sound data and communicate with the server.  

---

### **Data Collection**
- **Overview:**  
  Data collected at a gun range, capturing sounds from multiple firearm calibers at varying distances (5, 10, and 25 yards).  
- **Calibers Included:**  
  - Handguns: 9mm, .22LR, .380ACP, 10mm  
  - Shotguns: 12 Gauge  
  - Rifles: .300BLK, .300 WIN MAG, .308, 7.62x39, 5.56/.223  
- **Process:**  
  Sound samples were recorded, cleaned, and labeled to create a robust dataset for AI training.

### **Model Development**
- **Training:**  
  - Details the AI model architecture and training process.  
- **Deployment:**  
  - Describes how the trained model is integrated with the TAK platform.  
- **Integration:**  
  - Explains how the system connects hardware, software, and the AI model.

### SoundStrike Plugin for ATAK

The **SoundStrike Plugin** is a custom add-on for the ATAK platform that enables real-time visualization of detected sound events directly on the ATAK map interface. This plugin integrates seamlessly with the TAK Server and the AI detection system.

#### Prerequisites
1. **Download the ATAK SDK**:
   - Visit the official [TAK.gov](https://tak.gov) website.
   - Create an account (if required) and download the ATAK SDK.

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure that the ATAK SDK is installed and configured correctly on your development machine.
   - Install Java Development Kit (JDK) and Android Studio (if not already installed).

#### Adding the Plugin
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the plugin repository using:
     ```bash
     [https://github.com/YourUsernamesoundstrike.git]
    

2. **Build the Plugin**:
   - Open the project in Android Studio.
   - Sync the Gradle files to ensure all dependencies are downloaded.
   - Build the project to generate the plugin `.apk` file.

3. **Add Plugin to ATAK**:
   - Transfer the `.apk` file to your Android device.
   - Open ATAK on your device.
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Plugins** > **Install Plugin**.
   - Select the **SoundStrike Plugin** `.apk` file and install it.

#### Using the Plugin
1. **Connect to the TAK Server**:
   - Ensure your ATAK device is connected to the TAK Server configured in the **Sound Detection and Alert System**.

2. **Activate the Plugin**:
   - Go to **Plugins** in the ATAK interface.
   - Enable the **SoundStrike Plugin**.

3. **Visualize Events**:
   - Detected sound events will appear as icons on the ATAK map, showing the location, type of sound (e.g., gunshot, explosion), and timestamp.

4. **Event Details**:
   - Tap on an event icon to view detailed information, including the sound classification and confidence level.

#### Notes
- The SoundStrike Plugin requires ATAK version 4.5 or later.
- Ensure your TAK Server is properly configured with the necessary encryption and certificate settings.
- For further assistance, refer to the documentation provided in the plugin repository.
