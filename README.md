# **Project Name: Sound Detection and Alert System for ATAK**

### **Description**
A system designed to detect high-decibel sound events (e.g., gunshots) and visualize them in real time on the Team Awareness Kit (TAK) platform. This project integrates hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi, sound sensors) with AI models to enhance situational awareness for public safety and military operations.

### **About the Project**
- **Goal:** To detect and classify gunshots and other high-decibel sound events.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Real-time sound detection.  
  - Integration with TAK for immediate situational awareness.  
  - Support for multiple firearm calibers and sound profiles.  

---

### **System Architecture**
- **TAK Server Setup:**  
  Details the server configurations, including encryption, certificates, and integrations.  
- **Raspberry Pi Configuration:**  
  Explains how the Raspberry Pi is configured to process sound data and communicate with the server.  

---

### **Data Collection**
- **Overview:**  
  Data collected at a gun range, capturing sounds from multiple firearm calibers at varying distances (5, 10, and 25 yards).  
- **Calibers Included:**  
  - Handguns: 9mm, .22LR, .380ACP, 10mm  
  - Shotguns: 12 Gauge  
  - Rifles: .300BLK, .308, 7.62x39, 5.56/.223  
- **Process:**  
  Sound samples were recorded, cleaned, and labeled to create a robust dataset for AI training.

---

### **Model Development**
- **Training:**  
  - Details the AI model architecture and training process.  
- **Deployment:**  
  - Describes how the trained model is integrated with the TAK platform.  
- **Integration:**  
  - Explains how the system connects hardware, software, and the AI model.
